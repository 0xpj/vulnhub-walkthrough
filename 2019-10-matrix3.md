### Solution

![80](images/matrix3/80.png)

![7331](images/matrix3/7331.png)

We could infered that we should get the manger user:admin to get something www-data or ssh users.

![page_resource](images/matrix3/page_resource.png)

We watched page source of the http://192.168.0.107:80 code.

found  assets/img/Matrix_can-show-you-the-doo.png

![Matrix_can-show-you-the-door](images/matrix3/Matrix_can-show-you-the-door.png)

At first, i used some ctf ways to find wether has something hidden. Sadly, nothing found.

So may the Matrix is the directory.

![dir0](images/matrix3/dir0.png)

At first, we concate this chars, but nothing found. So we thought back the Matrix2,  the key **neo**

So we centered into this http://192.168.0.107/Matrix/n/e/o/6/4

![dir1](images/matrix3/dir1.png)

Found a secret.gz. After uncompressed failed , i decided to find the file type.

![user_passwd](images/matrix3/user_passwd.png)

this is txt file, and we found his user, password.

***user:admin, password-hash:76a2173be6393254e72ffa4d6df1030a***

we queried from online md5 decryption pagesite, the password is **passwd**

![manger](images/matrix3/manger.png)

So we logan in this page of http://192.168.0.107:7331

By viewing page resource, we found nothing. So we decided to use gobuster or dirb to scan his web directory

![dir3](images/matrix3/dir3.png)

We found /data/data, we downloaded it. found EXE file header ***4D5A90***

![exe](images/matrix3/exe.png)

This is a key hint, At first we scan from this txt, but nothing found, So we use EXE resource tools to do it.

![exe_code](images/matrix3/exe_code.png)

We found the user **guest** and his password **7R1n17yN30**.

the user-password keypair may ssh user and password. 

![ssh_guest](images/matrix3/ssh_guest.png)

Successfully!!!, Now we should to escalate our privilege.

![ls3](images/matrix3/ls3.png)

![vi](images/matrix3/vi.png)

We found this a rbash env, we use vi strick to jump the rbash.

![export](images/matrix3/export.png)

Ok, we saw the commnd not found , maybe the PATH is not assigned. So we exported by manual.

![find](images/matrix3/find.png)

Let's look those which owns suid permission file. Nothing found.

![sudo](images/matrix3/sudo.png)

We find wether the user guest's sudo privilege. We found trinity cp sudo privilege.

![ls1](images/matrix3/ls1.png)

So let's look trinity home directory. Found a .ssh directory, according sudo cp permisson, We can cp authorized_keys to login with trinity without password.

![ssh_trinity](images/matrix3/ssh_trinity.png)

Now we can login with user trinity, Let's see sudo privilege.

![sudo1](images/matrix3/sudo1.png)

So let's use oracle to escalate privilege to root, but the file wasn't found.

![ls0](images/matrix3/ls0.png)

So we can make a script called oracle to escalate root privilege.

![root](images/matrix3/root.png)

Finally, we cd /root and get the flag.

Successfully!!!
