### **Netdiscover**

We use the tools called netdiscover scan hosts, we found the 192.168.0.106 is our target virtualbox host ip.

### **Namp**


![nmap](images/dpwwn01/nmap.png)We found some services <u>SSH</u>, <u>HTTP</u>, <u>MYSQL</u> 

------

### Solution

At first, i try to gobuster to brute force the http dir, but nothing found only info.php. T_T

then, only have a mysql to find whether a clue has existed.

we use msf <u>auxiliary/scanner/mysql/mysql_login</u> to try users with empty password.

luckily,  root with empty password is successful!!!

![mysql_user_passwd](images/dpwwn01/mysql_user_passwd.png)


Now we have found username and password,  we may try to login in ssh.

![ssh](images/dpwwn01/ssh.png)


when we found this file, may the file can bring us to success, we guess the script will be run by crontab

![logrot](images/dpwwn01/logrot.png)

![crontab](images/dpwwn01/crontab.png)


so we can write our reverse shell in this logrot.sh , when crontab job execute it , we will get root privilege.

Let's to wait a little time, we will be successfullt soon.
