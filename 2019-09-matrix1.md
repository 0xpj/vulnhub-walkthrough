### **Netdiscover**

![netdiscover](images/matrix1/netdiscover.png)

We use the tools called netdiscover scan hosts, we found the 192.168.0.104 is our target virtualbox host ip. 

------

### **Namp**

![nmap](images/matrix1/nmap.png)

We found some services <u>SSH</u>, <u>HTTP</u>

------

### Solution

We centered into the http://192.168.0.104:80/ and http://192.168.0.104:31337/ , nothing found.

So we viewed page resource of the   http://192.168.0.104:31337/

![hint](images/matrix1/hint.png)

We found a string like base64 encoded. So we decoded it.

![base64dcode](images/matrix1/base64dcode.png)

Maybe this cur directory has Cypher.matrix. In fact, this a file, we downloaded from the url.

![brainfuck](images/matrix1/brainfuck.png)

Yeah, This a brainfuck code, we decoded it from online deocde website.

![brainfuck_decode](images/matrix1/brainfuck_decode.png)

We could know his most of password, so we build brute-force dictionary.

![wordlist](images/matrix1/wordlist.png)

We use hydra to brute force it.

![hydra](images/matrix1/hydra.png)

We found the password of **guest**, the password is **k1ll0r7n**

![ssh](images/matrix1/ssh.png)

So we ssh to login with guest user, successfully!!

![err0](images/matrix1/err0.png)

Sadlly, the bash is rbash, many commands are restricted. So we use vi trick.

![bash](images/matrix1/bash.png)

We try to use `set shell=/bin/bash ; shell` but error, So we use '!/bin/bash'.Successfully.

Then we export path to this path. 

`export PATH=/usr/bin:/bin`

![flag](images/matrix1/flag.png)

We found guest user that could exec any command, So we su root to get root privilege

Finally, we cd /root and get the flag.

Successfully!!!
